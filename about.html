    <!-- Founder Story -->
    <section class="about-founder">
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <h2>Founded on 20+ Years of Experience</h2>
                <p class="lead">Tone Entertainment was founded by <a href="https://mattcommerce.com" target="_blank" class="founder-link">Matt Commerce</a>—a professional musician, DJ, and entertainment industry pro with over 20 years of real-world experience.</p>
                
                <p>Across hundreds of live events, from intimate beachfront weddings to high-energy corporate galas, Matt studied the subtle details that shape an experience and mastered the art of creating moments people remember. As a guitarist, singer, and DJ, he's shared stages with artists including Usher, Sheryl Crow, Natasha Bedingfield, and Stevie Wonder—experience that's sharpened his instincts for what truly works in front of real audiences.</p>
                
                <p>Fluent in the languages of both performers and event planners, Matt leads a team built on reliability, versatility, and polish—so expectations are aligned, communication is clear, and execution is seamless, every time.</p>
                
                <p>His voice was voted one of NBC San Diego's "Top 10 Voices," and his debut album received critical acclaim from publications including North County Times and San Diego Troubadour. This deep experience as a performer gives Matt a unique perspective that sets Tone Entertainment apart—he doesn't just understand what clients want; he understands what works in real-time, in front of real audiences, in high-pressure situations where excellence isn't optional.</p>

    <!-- Philosophy -->
    <section class="philosophy-about">
        <div class="philosophy-content">
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            
            <p>In-person connection matters more than ever. Great music pulls people into the moment—away from their screens and into real connection—creating experiences and positive associations that last long after the event ends.</p>
            
            <p>Southern California is as beautiful as it is talent-rich. We connect you with world-class artists and use our local expertise to tap into the region's diverse music scene, so your event sounds as memorable as the setting itself.</p>
            
            <p>We believe great events don't have to come at the expense of the planet. With a network of elite performers across California, we prioritize booking talent close to home—reducing travel, lowering emissions, and simplifying logistics without compromising quality.</p>
            
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
